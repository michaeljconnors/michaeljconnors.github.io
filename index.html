<div>Every morning we wake up. Ahead of us is our day and many paths lie before us. Whether we realize that or not is another story. To be informed is important. It can mean the difference between success or failure, happiness or despair, and in some case, life or death.  
<br><br><strong>Here are some tips on when you can read and what. </strong>

<h2>Analysis of other website</h2>
<p>The example of a website that covers the same topic can be found <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/03/why-we-should-read-literature/">here</a>. What I like about this that makes the website good is they know how to make the image size right and they have links to social media. What I don't like how the site has so much written content (Ironicly). I think what makes it bad is the web pages need to be as consice as possible, and if the reader wants to learn more then have some way to expand or view more content.</p>
